## üîß TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

### Prompt Improvements Needed:
1. **CRITICAL: SEO Expert Transformation**:
   ```
   "You are an SEO content optimization specialist specializing in local SEO and keyword ranking"
   "Focus on SEO optimization, keyword targeting, and search engine ranking"
   "Optimize for both user engagement AND search engine visibility"
   ```

2. **SEO Phrase Targeting**:
   ```
   "Always include the exact phrase 'hublot watch repairs' naturally in the content"
   "Include UK location context in every optimized block"
   "Use local SEO terms like 'UK watch repair', 'British watch service'"
   "Target luxury watch repair keywords for SEO ranking"

## üéØ SUCCESS METRICS

### Quantitative:
- Overall quality score improvement
- Pass rate percentage
- SEO phrase inclusion rate
- Tone consistency score
- Content preservation score

### Qualitative:
- Natural language flow
- Brand voice consistency
- SEO optimization effectiveness
- User engagement potential

## üìã NEXT STEPS

1. **Start with Page R&D** - Understand the Hublot page thoroughly
2. **CRITICAL: Transform Prompt to SEO Expert** - Change from "content writer" to "SEO specialist"
3. **Improve Core Prompt** - Fix the main optimization prompt with SEO focus
4. **Create Fix Issues System** - Address remaining problems
5. **Test & Validate** - Measure improvements
6. **Document & Scale** - Apply learnings to other pages

## üéØ IMMEDIATE PRIORITY

**The current prompt is fundamentally wrong** - it's a "content writer" not an "SEO expert". This explains why:
- 94% of blocks are missing UK location context
- 36% are missing SEO phrases
- SEO score is only 4.9/10

**We need to fix the prompt identity first, then address the specific SEO requirements.**

## üîÑ ITERATIVE PROCESS

This is designed as an iterative improvement process:
1. Analyze current performance
2. Identify specific issues
3. Implement targeted improvements
4. Test and measure results
5. Refine and repeat

**Goal**: Create a reliable, high-quality AI content optimization system that consistently produces excellent results.
